# Control Systems Js Demo

## What is a control system?

A control system manages, commands, directs, or regulates the behavior of other devices or systems using control loops. It can range from a single home heating controller using a thermostat controlling a domestic boiler to large industrial control systems which are used for controlling processes or machines. The control systems are designed via control engineering process. Directly from wikipedia - :)

## What does this application do?

This application takes a *transfer function* and displays the associated zeros and poles as well as plotting a couple of the more common charts for Stability Analysis, Time-Domain and Frequency-Domain behavior

## How does it work?

You first have to input the transfer function numerator and denominator. This can be done writing numbers split by a ";". The first number will be the highest coefficient of the expression. A "1;2;3" represents the expression: "sÂ² + 2s + 3".

## But why?

This is actually just a demo for demonstrating the functionalities of a [Typescript library](https://github.com/Brenopms/systems-controls-js) built for aiding in system control analysis. There are just visual examples of the data generated using the package.

## How can I contribute?

You can check, make questions, open issues and pull requests in the [original repository](https://github.com/Brenopms/systems-controls-js). You can also check the code for this example [here](https://github.com/Brenopms/systems-controls-js-demo).
